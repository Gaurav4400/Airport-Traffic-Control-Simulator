 ### Problem Statement:
 Picture Book Application
 
 ### Aim:
 Our major focus will be on giving back power to the user, i.e., focusing majorly on user flexibility.
 
 ### Features:
  As there are many exciting features to implement in this project, we would like to go step by step:
  
 * **Initial Feature:** Our plan is to build a basic application that allows the user to upload their images and group them together.
     * Major Focus here is on handling large amount of data for a single user. 
     * For this we'll be exploring Apache as well as MongoDB.
     * Giving the user flexibility to create their own tags and grouping their photos will be an exciting challenge.
     * Add on to this will be making it work for multiple users.
     
 * **Additional Feature:** These are some features that we would love to explore:
     * Image editing Algorithm to playaround with the image. Firstly, we'll be working on basic features like rotate, crop, etc.
     * We can make the thumbnail customizable.
